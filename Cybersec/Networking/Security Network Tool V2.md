# Network Security Tool Report

## Introduction

In response to the evolving landscape of network security, the implementation of a robust network security tool becomes imperative. This Python script serves as a versatile tool designed to enhance security measures within a network infrastructure. The tool leverages automation capabilities to perform SSH connections, dynamically change configurations, and employ real-time packet inspection for proactive threat detection.

## Code Overview

The script encapsulates the following key functionalities:

### `NetworkSecurityTool` Class

This class serves as the core of the network security tool, containing methods for SSH connections, configuration changes, packet inspection, and more.

#### Initialization (`__init__` Method)

pythonCopy code

``def __init__(self):     # Initialization of router credentials, switch credentials, AI server IP, and VLAN change threshold     ```    - Initializes essential parameters such as router and switch credentials, AI server IP, and a VLAN change threshold.  #### SSH Connection to Device (`ssh_to_device` Method)  ```python def ssh_to_device(self, ip, username, password, command):     # Establishes an SSH connection to a device and executes a specified command     ```    - Uses the `paramiko` library to establish a secure SSH connection to a specified device, executing a provided command.  #### Change Switch Configuration (`change_switch_configuration` Method)  ```python def change_switch_configuration(self):     # Placeholder method for changing switch configuration based on unknown traffic detection     pass``

- Placeholder method for implementing logic to dynamically change the switch configuration based on the detection of unknown traffic.

#### Change Designated Router (`change_designated_router` Method)

pythonCopy code

`def change_designated_router(self):     # Placeholder method for changing the Designated Router (DR) daily     pass`

- Placeholder method for implementing logic to change the Designated Router (DR) on a daily basis.

#### Packet Inspection (`packet_inspection` Method)

pythonCopy code

``def packet_inspection(self, packet):     # Extracts source and destination MAC addresses, compares with trusted MACs, and verifies OSPF routing packet     ```    - Extracts source and destination MAC addresses from a network packet, compares them with trusted MAC addresses, and verifies the packet as a valid OSPF routing packet.  #### Forward to AI (`forward_to_ai` Method)  ```python def forward_to_ai(self, packet):     # Forwards the packet to VLAN 88 connected to the AI server for further inspection     ```    - Forwards a copy of the packet to VLAN 88, which is connected to an AI server for in-depth inspection and analysis.  #### Run Sniffer (`run_sniffer` Method)  ```python def run_sniffer(self):     # Runs the packet sniffer using scapy     ```    - Initiates a packet sniffer using the `scapy` library for real-time inspection of network packets.  ### Main Execution Block  ```python if __name__ == "__main__":     network_tool = NetworkSecurityTool()      # Perform SSH connection to routers     for router, credentials in network_tool.router_credentials.items():         command = 'show ip ospf neighbors'         result = network_tool.ssh_to_device(credentials['ip'], credentials['username'], credentials['password'], command)         print(f"Router {router} OSPF Neighbors:\n{result}")      # Run packet sniffer     network_tool.run_sniffer()``

This main execution block initializes an instance of the `NetworkSecurityTool` class, performs SSH connections to routers to collect OSPF neighbor information, and runs a packet sniffer for real-time analysis of network traffic.

## Conclusion

The network security tool represents a significant stride towards fortifying network defenses. The script's modularity allows for customization and expansion, catering to specific security needs and adapting to evolving network threats. This tool, with its SSH capabilities, dynamic configuration changes, and real-time packet inspection, establishes a foundation for robust network security practices. Further testing, refinement, and integration with a broader security framework will contribute to its efficacy in securing network infrastructures.
