This tool will be considered in Software-Defined Networking in later stages.
```

```
The main aim of this tool is as follows:

- To perform SSH connection to all company routers and switches considering networking automation using python, where all these routers are connected via a switch over a multiaccess network using single area OSPF protocol.

- To change the configuration of the switch whenever unknown traffic is detected over the multiaccess network.

- Changing the Designated Router (DR) daily over the shared network to avoid the same DR selection whenever the shared switch is restarted.

- The threat is detected by the thread over the shared network if unknown source and destination mac addresses are detected or other than OSPF routing information or network control PDUs are circulating over the network. A mac address is considered unknown if it doesn’t belong to any of the router interfaces over the shared multi-access network. Once a threat is detected the thread will change the operating VLAN connecting the routers over the multi-access network to another one and forward a copy to VLAN 88 which is connected to a server having an AI application that inspects the PDU over several layers, to enhance the future defense.

```

```
The tool works as follows:

- The tool extracts the source and destination mac addresses of any PDU circulating over the multiaccess network.

- The tool compares it with the trusted mac addresses of the routers’ interfaces connected to the switch to confirm that it is sent locally.

- The tool extracts the information from the routing packet to verify that the packet is a valid routing PDU from the trusted OSPF domain.

- In case of a PDU that doesn’t comply with the above requirements, the tool will forward the PDU to the AI application for further inspection.
